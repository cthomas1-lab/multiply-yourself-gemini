## 🎯 Philosophy


> *"Eliminating toil — if I do something twice, the third time a script does it."*
>
> *"Transcend syntax. Unlock innovation. Build great things."*
>
> *"You have a multi-PhD working for you now — don't limit yourself. If you can describe it, AI can probably help do it."*
>
> *"Process should be magnets, not gates. AI grants us the ability to do things right — and doing it right should pull people in, not block them out."*

> *Crafted by Shaun Robbins — one human + many tokens. Built to reduce toil for everyone to enjoy life a little bit more!*
