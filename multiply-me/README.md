# ⚡ Multiply Yourself (with Gemini)

## You're About to Become Dangerous

This isn't a tutorial. This isn't a tool guide. **This is a skill-building experience.**

By the time you finish this, you'll have an AI agent that writes code, runs commands, manages files, searches the web, and executes complex workflows—all while you focus on the *what* instead of the *how*.

You're not learning to use software. You're learning to **multiply yourself**.

> 🧠 **The shift:** Most people treat AI like autocomplete. You're about to treat it like a junior developer with a PhD in everything who never sleeps, never forgets, and does exactly what you tell it—if you know how to tell it.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

**You need access to the Gemini CLI.** Without it, none of this works.

> 📝 **Note:** This guide is built for the Gemini CLI, but the concepts translate to other AI-enabled IDEs and command-line tools with minor tweaks.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Point your AI agent at any of these guides and let it do the work for you:
> - *"Read the container setup guide and walk me through it."*
> - *"Run all the setup guides for me."*
> - *"Check if I have everything installed from the verification section."*

## 🧠 Key Philosophies

> **"No, you do it!"** - When the AI gives you suggestions instead of doing the work, use this to instruct the agent to do the work on your behalf and watch it produce magic.

> **Treat context windows like cattle, not pets** - Kill them often. Start fresh. Don't get attached.

> **Workflows should match YOUR thinking process** - Don't copy others. Build ones that fit how you work.
