# ⚡ Multiply Yourself

## You're About to Become Dangerous

This isn't a tutorial. This isn't a tool guide. **This is a skill building experience.**

By the time you finish this, you'll have an AI agent that writes code, runs commands, manages files, searches the web, talks to your tools, and executes complex workflows—all while you focus on the *what* instead of the *how*.

You're not learning to use software. You're learning to **multiply yourself**.

> 🧠 **The shift:** Most people treat AI like autocomplete. You're about to treat it like a junior developer with a PhD in everything who never sleeps, never forgets, and does exactly what you tell it—if you know how to tell it.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

**You need a Windsurf subscription** to unlock the Cascade AI agent. Without it, none of this works. Pretty sure its free for 2 weeks which is plenty enough time to get started. If you go with a paid account and want some free credits for me and you - here is my referrral code: https://windsurf.com/refer?referral_code=ds3ykrnoq9o6pvo3

> 📝 **Note:** This guide is built for Windsurf, but the concepts translate to Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, and other AI-enabled IDEs with minor tweaks.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Point your AI agent at any of these guides and let it do the work for you:
> - *"Read the container setup guide and walk me through it"*
> - *"Run all the setup guides for me"*
> - *"Check if I have everything installed from the verification section"*

## 🧠 Key Philosophies

> **"No, you do it!"** - When the AI gives you suggestions instead of doing the work, use this to instruct the agent to do the work on your behalf and watch it produce magic.

> **Treat context windows like cattle, not pets** - Kill them often. Start fresh. Don't get attached.
> *→ [Learn why in LLMs & Context](./concepts/llms-and-context/README.md#context-windows)*

> **Workflows should match YOUR thinking process** - Don't copy others. Build ones that fit how you work.
> *→ [Build your own workflows](./concepts/workflows/README.md)*
